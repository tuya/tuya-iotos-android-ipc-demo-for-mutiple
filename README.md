## Introduction

The demo code for Tuya Android Device IPC SDK is used for one-to-multiple application scenarios.

The launcher is the default startup application, which is used to launch the IPC process. In the launcher process, a persistent connection is made. When the launcher process is woken up, the current IPC process is killed and a new process is started.
